# Toad3D

Toad3D is a suite of MATLAB functions that are used to analyze 3D reconstructions of toad
prey capture behavior.

* toadProc: calculates metrics describing toad behavior from recordings.  
* checkerDLT: estimates plane of touchscreen from checkerboard images in multiple camera
views.
* videoAnnotater: generates an annotated video to check the quality of 3D reconstruction.
